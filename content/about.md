## About the site

This site collects a lot of useful sites I found during my daily life and researches.

The whole site was designed from scratch by me, a scientist but not a good web designer,
themed by the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework and
beautiful icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/),
powered by the fastest static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

The site is served freely on [GitHub](https://github.com/seisman/link.seisman.info),
with source codes available to public.
